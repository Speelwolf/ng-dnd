      This is the 'desugared' style, where you render an *ngFor explicitly.
      It's useful for integrating with other libraries like Material,
      hopefully. Other libraries love to include *ngFor themselves, but it
      should be clear you can attach `dndSortable` to whatever element you want,
      and then `dndSortableRender` to any of its children, even if they are not
      direct children or if some other library only lets you change the item
      template. You can even put a header element inside.

      Do not use both `dnd-sortable-list` AND `dndSortable` -- you will get
      double drop events!
