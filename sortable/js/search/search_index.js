It must return true for exactly one\ncard at a time, and that card MUST be placed under the most recently\nhovered DraggedItem.\nIf it is not implemented correctly, then each card will not be able to\ndetermine whether it is under the mouse (and therefore should not emit\nhover events); you will get a deluge of incorrect hover events.\nBy default, it is defined as:\ntrackBy(ground) === trackBy(inFlight.data)If you want to be able to copy cards around, and there's an extra clone\nin transit around the board, you have to be careful to implement\nisDragging correctly, or ensure that any clones have a different\ntrackBy() result. Note, however, that the item in beginDrag is the\noriginal, so simply giving clones a different id is not typically\nenough; the clone will not respond to isDragging, the original will\n(and you want to move the clone).\nTherefore, one solution is as follows:\nisDragging: (ground, inFlight) => {\n  let flyingId = this.isCopying ?

          \n\nGo back to @ng-dnd/core\n@ng-dnd/sortable\n\n\n\nInstallation\nMake sure you have @ng-dnd/core and a backend installed, ideally @ng-dnd/multi-backend. Read the core docs first, and make sure you have a firm grasp on it.\nyarn add @ng-dnd/sortableThen add DndSortableModule where required.\nimport { DndSortableModule } from '@ng-dnd/sortable';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // ...\n    // DndModule.forRoot( ... ),\n    DndSortableModule,\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}A sortable with truly ridiculous levels of customizability\nThis is different from the hundreds of other sortable libraries, because it is extremely pared back, and makes almost no limiting choices. This is NOT opinionated software.\n\nIt does no list operations for you. You drive the reordering and reverting yourself.\nIt is not coupled to DOM, so you can render your list and any previews or transit elements however you like.\nIt accepts a SortableSpec to define behaviour, much like a DragSourceSpec or DropTargetSpec but abstracted over a whole sortable and all elements in it.\nIt gives you the complete power of @ng-dnd/core to alter visuals as you see fit.\n\nSo yes, it's a bit harder to use than, say, ng2-dragula. Does the extra implementation effort pay off? There are so many cool uses, this section needs headings.\nVisuals and interaction\n\nYou can have non-sortable items inside your container. Like a header that you can still drop on when the sortable is otherwise empty.\nYou control all your visuals with DragSource.listen(), so apply your own classes based on isDragging and friends.\nYour drag previews are completely customizable (using [dragPreview] or ) like any other DnD item. Useful for making multi-select. Or axis snapping. Or showing warning messages ('you can't drop that here') alongside your mouse. Go for your life.\nYour dragged items can morph as they skip between two different lists, because they are completely re-rendered. This is great for a 'form builder' where library items/icons expand into full-size in-place templates when you drag them in.\nDrag handles are easy, just put the [dragSource] on something else.\n\nIntegration and IO\n\nYou can (in theory) use it with Material mat-tables, or any other list component.\nYou can insert 'external' elements by creating a DragSource (see [dndSortableExternal]).\nEach sortable item exists as a DnD item that can be dropped onto a normal drop target (like a trash can).\nYou don't need to use plain JS arrays, you can use Angular's FormArray or Immutable.js, because the library doesn't care. (Although you can do native but immutable updates with immer instead).\n\nData backing\n\nYou can easily implement the sorting in an @ngrx/store (some helpers make this even easier).\nYou don't have to hijack or revert someone else's predefined sort operations to implement 'multi-select & drag'\nIf you want to build keyboard navigation on top with identical operations, you don't have to mimic someone else's library operations, just refactor your own.\n\nTerminology\n\nitem: an @ng-dnd/core item, returned from beginDrag. In sortables, all these items are DraggedItem objects.\ndata: one of the JS objects in the backing array. It is opaque to the library, but you need a unique identifier field on it.\npreview: follows your mouse pixel by pixel. E.g. an HTML5 drag preview or a  from the multi-backend.\ntransit: you render this as part of the list while there is an item in-flight. Must follow the mouse, but not pixel for pixel.\ncontext: a small set of information enabling draggable elements to know where they are (index and data wise) without being coupled to the container's DOM children. Derived from a container and *ngFor data and index.\n\nUsage Overview\n\nHint: The best way to get started is by reading the example code.\n\nHere's a rough guide:\n\nSortableSpec is the data backing interface for your sortable. It defines the Skyhoook type, what happens when you hover on a new spot, drop an item, etc. Maybe you want to overwrite a list on a single component, maybe you are firing @ngrx/store actions. You must implement it according to the requirements and lifecycle.\n\nFor simpler list displays, make a container with  and provide it an  for each element.\n\nFor more complicated rendering situations, use dndSortable directive directly, and render an *ngFor inside it, pulling out let i = index as well.\n\nIn both options, for each draggable element, you need an [dndSortableRender]=\"context\" directive, which you need to get a reference to, and to finally attach [dragSource]=\"render.source\" somewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -

In general, this means you will be re-rendering \nyour list to match, and the NgForOf gives you new indexes.\nYou are free to implement drop and endDrag as you wish, but they should \nprobably involve 'save the temporary order' and 'set temporary = saved' \nrespectively.\nLifecycle\nThe following diagram summarises the calls made to SortableSpec during a drag.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Spec as SortableSpec\n    participant C as Component\n    participant S as ssSortable\n    participant R as origin ssRender\n    participant R2 as other ssRender\n    Note over R: user drags\n    R->>Spec: ask canDrag() ?\n    R->>Spec: beginDrag(item)\n    Spec-->>C: no changes\n    loop While Dragging\n        Note over R2: hover over otherssRender\n        R2->>Spec: ask canDrop() ?\n        R2->>Spec: hover(item)\n        Note right of Spec: children reordered to match item.hover\n        Spec-->>C: cause reordering\n        R-->R2: reorder\n    end\n    opt if dropped on ssSortable\n        S->>Spec: ask canDrop() ?\n        S->>Spec: drop(item)\n        Spec-->>C: cause reordering\n    end\n    R->>Spec: endDrag(item)\n    Spec-->>C: cause reordering\n\n\nmermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});\n\n'No changes' after beginDrag\nYou should not reorder anything within beginDrag. This would probably violate \nRequirement #1; moreover, it doesn't make any sense.\nThe particular item that got picked up will be able to react, because \ndndSortableRender.isDragging$ will emit true.\nThe implementation of 'Cause reordering' is up to you\nYou can implement this at the most basic level by setting variables on a \ncomponent that isn't OnPush; you could also use RxJS, @ngrx and other more \npowerful solutions.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
